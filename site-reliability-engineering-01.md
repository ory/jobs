### About the Job 
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, massively distributed, fault-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that ORY's services—both our internally critical and our externally-visible systems—have reliability, uptime appropriate to users' needs and a fast rate of improvement. Additionally SRE’s will keep an ever-watchful eye on our systems capacity and performance. Much of our software development focuses on optimizing systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation. 

We're looking for rocket-smart and talented engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, UI design and mobile. The list of relevant areas goes on and is growing exponentially.

As a systems engineer, you will work on projects critical to ORY’s needs with opportunities and that shape how the ORY business grows and evolves. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push emerging cloud technology forward.

ORY is an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make a significant impact on how data is managed and shared in the cloud and on the internet.

ORY needs execution focused engineers to help shape the future of cloud computing and to help us expand our already sizable effort exponentially. You will be building cutting edge cloud technology that is already powering a number of the large and innovative companies worldwide.

### Responsibilities

* Engage in and improve the whole life cycle of services — from inception and design through to deployment, operation and refinement.
* Support services before they go live through activities such as system design consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, capacity planning, and launch reviews.
* Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability, latency, and overall system health.
* Scale systems through mechanisms like automation; evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity.
* Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems.
