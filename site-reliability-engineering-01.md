## Software Engineer / SRE

We are looking for people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's challenges and work with others to create world class solutions

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) combines software and systems engineering to build and run large-scale, distributed, fault-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that services have reliability, uptime appropriate to users' needs and a fast rate of improvement. Additionally SRE’s will keep watchful eyes on our systems capacity and performance. Our software development focuses on building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation.

Your responsibilities will include:

* Engage in and improve the whole life cycle of services — from inception and design through to deployment, operation and refinement.
* Support services before they go live through activities such as system design consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, capacity planning, and launch reviews.
* Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability, latency, and overall system health.
* Scale systems through mechanisms like automation; evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity.
* Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems.

You should have experience in:

* The field of Computer Science.
* One or more of the following : C, C++, Java Script, Python, Go, or Ruby.
* Analyzing and troubleshooting systems.
* Unix/Linux operating systems internals and administration e.g., filesystems, inodes, system calls or networking e.g., TCP/IP, network topologies and hardware, and SDN.
