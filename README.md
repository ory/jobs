We build stuff for an emerging cloud infrastructure. It’s security, zero trust, hardcore bullet proof engineering.
It’s Golang, K8S, React, Hashicorp etc. - no more buzzwords! Just [open an issue](https://github.com/ory/jobs/issues/new)
and go ahead, make our day :) - or drop us a short introductory email to [jared@ory.sh](mailto:jared@ory.sh). We believe that great engineering deserves to be paid accordingly.

Our open positions:

* [Software Engineer / React](software-engineer-02.md)
* [Software Engineer / SRE](site-reliability-engineering-01.md)
